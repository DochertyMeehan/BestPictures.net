#### Description:
  Ever since I was young I have been in love with all kinds of film whether it was your standard movie,
ski film, documentary etc.. Being someone who watched a lot of movies, It was always a struggle to find
new things to watch that were captivating and done right. My parents always made the same suggestion
when I was struggling to find good things to watch, "Always check the best picture category of the Oscars.
That became my number one step for finding something to watch. While having spent many hours looking for
the best picture winners and nominees alike, I found that there wasn't a super user friendly website for finding
these films. Most websites I have checked are either unclear, hard to navigate, or missing key information.
The goal for my final project was to create a simple, user-friendly website that shows every best picture and
best picture nominee for the entire lifespan of the Oscars.

    The first file to take note of is the styles.css file that outlines the design for different sections of the website.

    Upon opening BestPictures.net, you will be taken to the homepage of the site. On the homepage, there
is a header that simply says the name of the site as long as a short description of what the website is for
as well as how to navigate through the pages. I included a patterned background as well as a color scheme on my homepage and
throughout the rest of the site to give a feeling that aligns with the "Blockbuster" franchise. Below the header of the
homepage, there is a long list of buttons labeled with a year for each of the years that the Oscar film competition was held.
My project contains a different page for each one of these years spanning from the last Oscar competition held in 2022 to the
first ever award ceremony held in 1929. To find out more about the best picture and nominees for each year, the user must
simply click the button that corresponds with the year they want to know more about.


    When a button on the homepage is clicked, the user is then taken to a secondary or winner page. these pages
are completely different when it comes to the content on them but are all similar in design. Every secondary or winner
page contains multiple sections. The first thing the user will see is the winner heading that shows the year of the page
the user clicked on the homepage. In this section the name of the best picture that won the award ceremony for that year
will be displayed in big white text next to the cover picture for that movie. Right below the name and picture there is
a short description of the movie as well as the name of the director of the movie, and the movies rating on the Internet
Movie Database. The description of the movie gives the user an idea of what the movie is about and lets them know
if it might be something they would be interested in watching. The IMDb rating gives the user an idea of how others
felt about the movie. High IMDb ratings are a good indication that the movie is worth watching. Below the Winner
section is a section containing all of the information pertaining to the nominees for that year. This information
includes the name of all the movies as well as the movies IMDb rating. Within these secondary or winner pages, the user is
given at least 5 movies that were among the highest rating films of the year, giving them plenty of suggestions of what
to watch. Below this is a home button to return the user to the homepage where they can select a different year.


    My goal for this project was to create a very simple, easy to navigate website that gives users plenty of ideas
on new things to watch. Being a movie person myself, I have found that looking through the best picture nominations
and winners is the best/fastest way to find a film that is worth your time. Although there are other ways to find these
online, BestPictures.net is a one stop shop. I have already found myself using the website in my free time.
